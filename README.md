# OTel Observability Lab Showcase

> **App observability tells you something is broken. Network observability tells you why.**

> 🔒 **Code Access Note:**
A fully production-grade lab demonstrating **Network (eBPF) + APM (OpenTelemetry SDK) + LLM (OpenLLMetry)** observability married into one vendor-agnostic OTel pipeline — across AWS EKS, on-prem k3s, GCP GKE, and Azure AKS. Open a GitHub Issue to request access.

Built by [Surit Maharana](https://linkedin.com/in/surit-maharana) — Principal Network Observability Engineer with 20+ years at JPMorgan Chase, applying enterprise-grade telemetry patterns to cloud-native infrastructure.

## What this demonstrates

| Layer | Tool | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Network (L3/L4) | Cilium + Hubble | Flow metrics, drops, DNS failures, TCP retransmits |
| Network (L7) | Grafana Beyla (eBPF) | HTTP spans with W3C traceparent — zero code changes |
| APM | OpenTelemetry SDK | Distributed traces, metrics, logs |
| LLM | OpenLLMetry (traceloop-sdk) | Token count, cost, latency — in the same trace as HTTP |
| Backends | Dash0 → Dynatrace → Datadog | Same OTel signal, three lenses |

---

## The money shot (Phase 3)

TCP retransmits are injected between services. The app SDK shows elevated latency but **no error**. Hubble shows packet drops. Beyla shows span duration increase. **Root cause visible only at the network layer** — not in app traces alone.

This is the failure mode your APM will never catch.

## Quick start (Phase 1)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suritm7543/otel-observability-lab
cd otel-observability-lab

# Deploy EKS cluster (takes ~15 minutes)
terraform -chdir=terraform/eks init
terraform -chdir=terraform/eks apply

# Configure kubectl
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-2 --name otel-lab

# Verify nodes are ready
kubectl get nodes
```
